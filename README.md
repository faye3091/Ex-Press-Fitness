  ## Description
  One thing average people struggle with when it comes to fitness is getting started or logging their workouts. With Ex-Press Fitness, you'll be able to create your own custom profile that will keep track of exercises the user enters. if the user wanted to filter their results there are buttons to help. All this data can be private and would fall under HIPPA law,meaning it is protected information. Protected Info is important that's why there is also a passcode! The passcode is something that the user creates so only they have access to their data.
